## Introduction

```mank
proc main {
  println!("Hello World!");
}
```

Mank is a modern, strongly typed and garbage-collected mid-level language.
Mank aims to provide more safety and portability than C, whilst also providing high-level features, such as
lambdas & closures, type inference, ~~generics~~, and more.
